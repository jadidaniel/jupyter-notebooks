    "# Predicting Income\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be using an ensemble machine learning technique - **Random Forest** - on a dataset containing [census information from UCI’s Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult/). By using census data with a random forest, we will try to predict whether a person makes more than $50,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is a technique that allows to prevent overfitting on training data which single Decision Tree algorithms are often prone to. The idea is simple: Random Forest contains many Decision Trees that all work together to classify new points - it’s like every tree gets a vote, and classification that got the maximum number of votes, wins.\n",
